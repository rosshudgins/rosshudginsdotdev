Welcome to rosshudgins.dev

I'm a software developer, so I should have my own website. As of right now I'm intending this to be a home for blog posts about software development - technical stuff and soft-skills. I may end up writing and sharing about other things, but that's very much TBD.

I'm glad you're here - I'd love to connect through any of the social links on the sidebar here. Thanks!
