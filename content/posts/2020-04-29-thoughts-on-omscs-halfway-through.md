description: I've been enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program for about a year
  and a half now and just finished my 4th and 5th courses out of the required
  10. I'd like to share some brief reviews of some courses I've took and share
  how it's been useful to me.

## Motivation

data engineering role

data is just really cool

tuition reimbursement

## Course

### Software Testing and Analysis

Typescript

### HCI

writing

### Cyber-Physical Systems

really didn't love this course - sloppy assignments and not really applicable

### ML4T

great intro to ML - code + reports really helped concepts sink in

### DVA

honestly didn't watch any lectures

assignments were a nice overview and intro to a lot of different tools - I really liked the tools for cleaning data, lot of power there
