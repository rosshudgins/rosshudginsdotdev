description: I've been enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program for about a year
  and a half now and just finished my 4th and 5th courses out of the required
  10. I'd like to share some brief reviews of some courses I've took and share
  how it's been useful to me.

## Motivation

I had a fascinating introduction to Big Data and some basics of Machine Learning (although the course was titled [Information Storage and Retrieval](http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce470_2014/index.html)) in my undergrad at Texas A&M that really blew my mind at the time. There weren't really any more related opportunities at the time though, so this interest just stuck around in the back of my mind.

I had never thought I'd even consider going back to school for a master's degree, but my brother in law encouraged me to look into some machine learning education. Of course there are plenty of free and cheap online courses and tutorials, but personally I benefit more from more structured learning and like the potential of earning a degree. There are a handful of options (more now than when I started looking) but some are much more expensive than others. Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-machine-learning) with a specialization in Machine Learning seemed to check all the boxes for me. Also, since the company I work for offer tuition reimbursement, it seemed like a no-brainer for me to apply.

Obviously I'm here writing this, so spoiler alert, I was accepted and enrolled starting in January 2019. At this point I've completed 5 of the 10 required courses

## Course

### Software Analysis and Test

OMSCS enrolls a ton of students, so registering for the more interesting and specialized courses is really hard to do early. I opted to take just one course for my first semester as others online have recommended so I could get a feel of how courses work and make sure I could manage my time along with working full time.

[This course](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6340-software-analysis) really was very interesting and a great academic and theoretical overview of software analysis tools and methods. Although it was interesting, most of the content honestly wasn't that applicable to my work. I was really glad to see a section of this course devoted to discussing Typescript. I thought it showed an effort to keep the course up to date and applicable to a greater breadth of students.

### Cyber-Physical Systems

really didn't love this course - sloppy assignments and not really applicable

### Human-Computer Interaction

writing

### ML4T

great intro to ML - code + reports really helped concepts sink in

### DVA

honestly didn't watch any lectures

assignments were a nice overview and intro to a lot of different tools - I really liked the tools for cleaning data, lot of power there
