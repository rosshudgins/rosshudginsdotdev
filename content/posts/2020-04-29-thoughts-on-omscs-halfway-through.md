description: I've been enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program for about a year
  and a half now and just finished my 4th and 5th courses out of the required
  10. I'd like to share some brief reviews of some courses I've took and share
  how it's been useful to me.

## Motivation

I had a fascinating introduction to Big Data and some basics of Machine Learning (although the course was titled [Information Storage and Retrieval](http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce470_2014/index.html)) in my undergrad at Texas A&M that really blew my mind at the time. There weren't really any more related opportunities at the time though, so this interest just stuck around in the back of my mind.

data engineering role

data is just really cool

tuition reimbursement

## Course

### Software Testing and Analysis

cool automated test stuff like fuzzing and OOP stuff, but not super applicable for my work

Typescript

### Human-Computer Interaction

writing

### Cyber-Physical Systems

really didn't love this course - sloppy assignments and not really applicable

### ML4T

great intro to ML - code + reports really helped concepts sink in

### DVA

honestly didn't watch any lectures

assignments were a nice overview and intro to a lot of different tools - I really liked the tools for cleaning data, lot of power there
