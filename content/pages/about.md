Hey there, I'm Ross Hudgins. I'm a software developer living in central Texas with my wife Colleen and dog Howie. I spend my free time playing soccer, [making music](https://www.facebook.com/LeavenworthBand/), cooking, reading, and enjoying craft beer and cocktails.

I've been a backend developer for [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/) since 2016 and have been pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning through Georgia Tech's [](https://www.viasat.com/)[OMSCS](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program.
